<p>Well, there’s a lot of options. Let’s start with HTML. HTML is an abbreiviation for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create websites and is a case-sensitive language. There are other languages that go along with HTML like CSS, and JavaScript which are used to tell the website what to do when someone clicks a button, or in CSS’s case it’s used to style the webpage. Now, you may be asking “How do I even install it?”. HTML is a basic filetype that comes with windows meaning you can litterally edit it in notepad. However I would recommend VS Code instead of notepad, as it will give you the upper hand if you want to get into programming a bit more.</p>
